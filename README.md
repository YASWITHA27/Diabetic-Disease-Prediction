# Diabetes Prediction Model

This project focuses on analyzing and building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes with high accuracy. The dataset was prepared using various preprocessing techniques to ensure quality training data. Multiple classifiers were evaluated, and it was found that K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the highest accuracy of 81.81%, outperforming the Naive Bayes classifier.

Key Features:

Data preprocessing and feature selection for optimal model performance.
Comparison of multiple classifiers (KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes) for predictive accuracy.
Insights into the effectiveness of classifiers for diabetes prediction.
This project highlights the importance of selecting the right model for achieving high accuracy in healthcare-related predictions.
